Last night, I read a passage on Zhihu Daily.It recommended lots of wonderful websites to learn online.I also noted some websites that was fresh for me.So here I decide to try to sort out some excellent websites I have already known.Definitely that means I will update this list when I find more.And I’m sorry that this list may almost match my own hobbies,such as coding.


MOOCs(Massive Open Online Course):

- Coursera(Maybe the most popular MOOC website)
- edX(Almost from Harvard and MIT)
- Udacity(The course archive is always there)
- XuetangX(Chinese courses offered by Tsinghua University)

Some others:
- Khan Academy

- Free Online Classes(A collection of online courses)

- Netease Open Course

- Netease Cloud Course(To learn skills)

- Howzhi(A community to share knowledge)


Ideas and thoughts:

- TED(Ideas worth spreading)
- Solve for X(A think tank project launched by Google to incite collaboration to solve global issues)


Coding:

- Codecademy(Strongly recommended,A interactive learning website for Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP), Ruby, Python, and Miscellaneous)
- Stackoverflow(A Q&A website)
- Lynda(To learn computer skills)
- Opensourceforce(There’re lots of IT pioneers)


Resource Library:


For me,this is my online library to get resource I need.


First,some Q&A websites.


- Zhihu(If I answer a question and can get the most approval,I can even forget the tasty of meat)


    In fact,it can be difficult to find those wonderful answers. So first you need to notice some core users.They are clever,knowledgeable and most important helpful.They can help you broaden your horizon.And also you can install Zhihu’s app on your smartphone. Zhihu Daily can be wonderful,there’re some excellent answers selected to publish every day.And what’s more,there’s Zhihu Roundtable.


    There’s a list of users that is worth noticing.Click here.


- Quora(Maybe better than Zhihu)


    Also there’s a list of recommended users on Quora.Click here.


- And as I just mentioned,Stackoverflow.


Second,some communities.


- Douban(Books,movies,music,groups etc.)


    I like Douban because I can always get some surprise every day and learn to change my life little by little.


- CSDN(An IT community)
