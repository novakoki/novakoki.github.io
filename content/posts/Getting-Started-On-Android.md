This term I ,or should be we,decided to develop an android app.So recently I have been searching for some resources online.For example,the class I mentioned ever on Cousera. However, sometimes I would be fed up with the speed of the teacher and I can’t still watch the videos. Maybe I need a book.Luckily I found a set of documents on the android official website.Then I realize that once you have any problem,your first choice to solve it should be the android official reference.The introduction of all APIs and classes you may use is just there,waiting for you.But sometimes I also feel it would be a little hard to fetch what you need because of the large quantity of information. How lucky!Google has written a tutorial for the beginner like me.You can just follow its steps,introduction,and tips. Well,let me make a summary of my beginning. First,I learn how to create an android application project.And in this process some points as followings:



The package name of app should be unique and it can’t be changed later.
The minimum required SDK determines your app’s compatibility but can be changed later.
And you can edit your app’s icon and the kind of the main activity.
Second,building a simple UI.


Finally,starting another activity,making communication along activities and transferring simple data like text.


Well,so I’m getting started and I will work harder!Come on!
